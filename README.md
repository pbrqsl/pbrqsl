# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a **Python Developer** with 18 years of experience in system administration, automation, and data analysis. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve been transitioning from managing infrastructure to building software, focusing on web development, data-driven applications, and automation solutions.

ðŸ’» My coding journey started with automating tasks in **PowerShell**, scripting in **SQL** for data analysis, and creating reports with **Splunk**. Now, Iâ€™m fully immersed in Python development, working on projects with **Django**, **REST APIs**, and deploying them using **Docker** and **AWS**.

ðŸš´ In my free time, Iâ€™m passionate about cycling and diving into fascinating **true crime** stories.
